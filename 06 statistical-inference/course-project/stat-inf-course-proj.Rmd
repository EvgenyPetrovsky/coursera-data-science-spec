## Define parameters

In this project we will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with `rexp(n, lambda)` where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. we will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials doing a thousand simulations.

```{r set parameters}
n <- 40
lambda <- 0.2
dist <- rexp(n, lambda)
```
